Scripts & Plugins for Vanilla Racktables
========================================
This Repository contains some Scripts and Plugins for the Asset-Management Software
Racktables. 


Modified Racktables
=====================
It also contains a "Patch" for Racktables for extended functionality, like
a new Status for Hardware that is not mounted yet, an Export for labelling Cables,
and "monitoring" for Servers with no Management Address.
To achieve this the base of Racktables was modified, and is not updatable through the
Original Version of Racktables.
